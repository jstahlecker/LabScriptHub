# ITC Final Figure

## Overview

This script generates a final figure for an ITC (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) experiment, styled similarly to the classic Origin final figure. The layout has been slightly updated to also include a residuals plot.

> **Note:** This script works exclusively with `.csv` files exported from the PEAQ-ITC analysis software.
