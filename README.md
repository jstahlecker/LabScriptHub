  Scripts for Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) data analysis.  
  - **`nanoDSF/`**: Scripts and configurations for nanoDSF experiments.  
  - **`Qiagen_RotorGeneQ/`**: Preprocessing scripts for DSF data from the Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q machine.
  -  **`Origin/`**: A small Add-on script to automate smoothing, differentiation and basic peak detection using Origin.

- **`ITC/`**  
  Scripts for Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) data analysis.  
  - **`itc200/`**: Tools for ITC data visualization and final figure generation.  

- **`NMR/`**  
  Scripts for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data analysis.  
  - **`Bruker/`**: Tools for processing and plotting 1D and 2D NMR data.  

- **`Optical_Assays/`**  
  Scripts for optical assay data preprocessing and analysis.  
  - **`CLARIOstar/`**: Preprocessing scripts for fluorescence polarization assays.  

- **`HPLC/`**
